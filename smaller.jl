(UK)", "user": "westham88", "post": "Hi AllRecently I had a consultation in central London with an Allergy clinic. My skin prick test showed i'm Allergic to Dust Mite, Tree/Grass Pollen, Cats and Mould. My doctor mentioned in the UK we only treat one allergy at a time and the method is usually SLIT which cost \u00a32000 for a years supply of tablets. I've been trying to find somewhere that does the shots for multiple allergies within the UK but am not having much luck. From what i've read on this forum, people get treated for multiple Allergies and they really see the benefit.For any that its helpful to, the recommendation in the consultation was to go through the following routine each day. The main thing that helped me was to start using multiple medications and double the dosage.Morning1. Neilmed Nasal Rinse2. Steroid Nasal Spray3. Asthma Inhaler4. FexofendineEvening1. Neilmed Nasal Rinse2. Steroid Nasal Spray3. Asthma Inhaler4. Fexofenadine5. Montelukast I also have to add Rinatec (Ipratropium Bromide) to my routine otherwise my nose just runs constantly all day.Additionally I would have liked to have gone for an appointment with the NHS, however the nearest appointment was 2 months away and I was suffering quite badly. If its helpful to anyone my consultation and testing came to \u00a3419.Thanks"}

I got two shots a week for 4 allergies (mites, tree and weeds and mold), later added one more ingredient for a new allergy (grass).It makes sense to start with low dose shots and build up until you hit your tolerance. Maybe the new pills are better, but I'd wait until the price comes down or health care pays for them.I'd also wait for the NHS appointment instead of paying so much for an unsatisfactory private one.  I'm in the US, but would wait for something free.  I just waited 2 months for a special or oral surgeon appointment for a simple skin tag inside my mouth, and now have to wait another month for him to actually snip it (dentist where I can get in tomorrow can't do this), so waiting happens everywhere.I can't tell you what allergy meds might help better, but my shots \"cured\" my allergies after taking them for several years, and now I just take montelukast once a day."}

I thought i'd post a quick update for anyone it may be useful to.Since my last post, I've had one more Private consultation at another clinic and just recently one for free on the NHS.Second Private AppointmentThe conclusion was that Multiple Allergies can be treated at the same time. Although in the UK we use SLIT as its supposedly more convenient for everyone involved, personally i'm not quite sure, if your having to take daily drops for each individual Allergy, 15 minutes apart, ontop of your current Allergy routine, it does get a bit much. I ended up purchasing 6 months of HDM SLIT for \u00a3900 and 6 months of Pollen for \u00a3900. My doctor suspects i'll know within 4 months if the treatment is effective and whether to continue.NHS AppointmentThe UK doctor basically told me I shouldn't shop around and Multi Sensitized people like me need to accept there Ill and treat symptoms as opposed to looking for a 'Cure'. She mentioned how she wouldn't have even started me on SLIT, as they only help people with one or very rarely two Allergies. She mentioned in the UK we do not desensitize multiple allergies because it doesn't work very well. The conclusion was to carry on SLIT for 6 months and let the NHS doctor know how I get on. I am also currently trialing Intranasal Capsaicin to see if it helps with the watery runny nose.ThanksPost Edited (westham88) : 12/5/2017 4:25:27 AM (GMT-7)"}

The primary symptoms of GERD are heartburn, regurgitation, and nausea. Other symptoms of GERD include: Frequent heartburn. Heartburn usually is described as a burning pain in the middle of the chest. It may start high in the abdomen or may extend up into the neck. Sometimes the pain may be sharp or pressure-like, rather than burning. Such pain can mimic heart pain (angina). In other patients, the pain may extend to the back. Typically heartburn related to GERD is seen more commonly after a meal. Hoarseness .If acid reflux gets past the upper esophageal sphincter, it can enter the throat (pharynx) and even the voice box (larynx), causing hoarseness or a sore throat. Laryngitis Nausea Sore throat Chronic dry cough, especially at night. GERD is a common cause of unexplained coughing. It is not clear how cough is caused or aggravated by GERD. Asthma. Some of these nerves that are stimulated by the refluxed acid stimulate the nerves to the lungs, which then can cause the smaller breathing tubes to narrow, resulting in an attack of asthma.

I have always been healthy.  Mine started a  year and a half ago for no reason that I can fathom.  I have just lived with it as my doctors thought it might be stress.  I did have a lot of life changes about that time but for the better!! Go figure.  My Primary dr. put me on Valium 2.5 mg. 3x day for two weeks.  He did this twice and my symptoms almost went away but then returned when I went off the Valium.  He did not want to treat me long term with Valium so told me to see a shrink.  I have just been avoiding that as a last resort.  I recently saw a pulmonologist at Mayo in Jax and he said I passed the breathing test except when they used the methacholine and I did not pass that part.  But unless an irritant is put into my lungs I breathed fine on the test.  I travel all over the US so do not believe this is environmental either.I have had two acupuncture procedures and am going to continue them for two weeks as the dr. said I should see some difference.  It can be expensive if your ins. does not pay as mine does not but at least there are no side effects.  If this does not work I guess I will try the Advair just to rule out asthma.  I just am afraid of all the side effects.  Have you ever taken Advair?  If that does not work I will  give in and go to the shrink.  Sometimes your body can be under stress and you do not realize it.I would love to hear your story if you have time.  Are your symptoms daily?  Do you sleep at night ok?  When do you notice it getting worse or better.  For me it seems to just be better some days and worse some days for no apparent reason.  Do you ever have problems swallowing?  I have a little right now as I have post nasal drip combined with the breathing makes me almost choke at times!Thanks so much for responding.  It is comforting to know someone else has the same problem and I am not crazy... although I am sorry that you do.Puddycat"}

Well I did, I can remember as it was August 19, 2005. I was dealing with the cold, and after a few days I could not breathe. I went to the emergency room and this is when it all started.   It took about 3 Months until I could breathe a bit better, and only a bit. I could not laugh, eat very well, without being out of breath. It was terrible. I was in bed for a couple months. Yes, a couple Months. it was that bad. I have never in my life done drugs or smoked. I am not 48 but was 43 years old at the time.  My lungs Improved but have not returned to good breathing as of yet. They had improved some,  so we finally wanted to get out of the house, took a drive out to east county, we stopped to eat at a casino, the next day I could not breathe again, it was BAD again, well, there was cigarette smoke in the casino. Never before was I sensitive to smoke. It pretty much re aggravated the inflammation.  That is pretty much the beginning of this for me. I now have Your exact symptoms. Everyday, all day, I generally can not breath correctly. The cold caused inflammation that has apparently not cleared up. Yes I have tried Advair, for me it gave me a horrible, horrible headache, but it is so individual for everyone. I was on Asmanex, Singuliar, and still have albuterol. The doctor has now, taken me off all the meds.  Except I have albuterol in my purse.  I hardly ever use, it, I told him I could use it every day, but is that a good idea, he said I should use it only when really frustrated.   I have tried, a GREAT healthy diet, I eat very well, I drink tons of water, I have tried different breathing techniques. There is no rhyme or reason, at this time, why I am having these problems breathing.   I can sleep well, I don't have any coughing. It seems to generally have no rhyme or reason, for being there or Yes, some days it gets worse. In the humid summer, it seems to get worse. I now avoid smoke. I don't have a stressful life. Its there all the time. The breathing problem. My doctors describe it as not being able to get a \"satisfied breath\" the break over, I call it that you inhale, and then it gets stuck, you can't get that satisfied breath. It is so annoying as so many here know.   However, I have been on this forum, reading, and signed in yesterday, because when i saw that you have the exact symptoms, others writings each one was different with symptoms. I am hoping that there is maybe something we can figure out to help each other with something some bit of helpful information to be of help with this. Hopefully the Advair will clear it up for you. That would be great.   I know what you are living with. The good sign, for me is that is does get somewhat better, not all the way, but of course, I am hoping that it will get better and not return. I have a good doctor a specialist. I do trust his judgement. He was correct about taking me off the meds, as they did not eliminate the symptoms. So there was no reason to be on them. His feeling is time will hopefully heal this, as I have made improvements from where I started as you can see, but not there yet.   We have clear air here. I actually know what started this for me. It is interesting that we both are experiencing the same thing. Thank you for replying. It is a frustrating thing. I can tell you for me, you have already helped, by reading your symptoms, meaning, now I feel that this exists so there must be someway to help us, as we are not the only ones. I am sorry you are dealing with this also, but there must be some additional explanation for us, and to find help.  Again, hopefully the advair will clear it up, please keep me posted. I have a doctor appot. on the 19th of next week, a follow up I go every 6 months unless I would like to come in sooner.   Try this is you like, sometimes it works for me. If you can't take a deep breath, to get the satisfied breath, try sitting up straight and taking the breath, or walk around the room or do some twists, to push air into your lungs. I know what a thing to do just to try to get a breath, but this is actually a clue for me. It sometimes seems that I need to push air to fill my lungs. Its almost like I need more air to fill my lungs to get that deep breath. Believe me I have tried so many different things. Another thing I just thought of is I did have blood taken to do a full allergy test. I am not allergic to anything. You may want to try having an allergy test.have a wonderful fresh air day to you all here in this forumPost Edited (sunnyside3) : 1/15/2010 5:06:50 PM (GMT-7)"}

The 3 acupuncture treatments did not help I am sorry to say.  I would do more if I felt any relief at all but it is an expensive treatment ongoing.  Guess I will bite the bullet and start the Advair soon.  Do you mind telling me what part of the country you live in?  Just wondering if we are in the same area.  I travel between TN and FL mostly.Hope you are having a good week.  Puddycat"}

I don't have any tightness in my chest. I had even gotten a cold last December and it did not change my breathing either way, for the good or bad. Which I considered a Victory.   Then, I don't think I will try the acupuncture, here my guy is or was, the last time I went, not for this though, he is 75.00 per session. I bet that is the going rate.   I am in California. Southern California. We are having rain storms all week. Has your breathing Improved. I really hope so. Let me know how the Advair helps. I know you are concerned about taking it. I can tell you to help possibly, it gave me a headache, yes it is a bit scary but as soon as I stopped and the drug wore off it stopped. So maybe it will lessen any worry about having a side effect. Talk with your doctor. I have read here allot of people use it just fine with no problems.   Thanks again, for answering I was looking forward to hearing from you. As said, I would like to hopefully get some insight from people here, hopefully. The writings do offer some help reading about how others are coping. You just seem to have the similiar issue as I do, no one is exact, but it was like reading what I live with daily.   Take care"}

I sometimes wheeze but not very often. I had a big argument with my doctor today as he wouldn't believe me saying I can't breath!!All started from a bad flu on December 2013. it was the worst one I have ever had in my life. I was coughing for almost 2 months and developed chest infection. I was not able to sleep at night. My doctor gave me a course of 5 days antibiotics,and the infection was removed after that.On January 2014, I could feel my breathing was not same as before. It got really bad on May and I had to see my Dr again and he sent me through many different tests to diagnose the problem. I had twice X-ray, CT scan on my chest, Spirometry, blood test and heart echocardiogram and all came back normal. My Thyroid, liver and kidney tests and oxygen level were also normal.I tried all sorts of inhalers, singular, herbal drugs.I have a pretty relaxing life, I exercise 3 times a week and I am about to finish my PhD and in general I am a happy person. That is why I could not accept it caused by anxiety. I also tried Xanax for 10 days which did not change my breathing.I don't know what to do please help me.Arash"}

The breathing issues have just come on more recently but have had bad health issues for a while now (5+) years. Basically, I have gerd, ibs at times, PVCs and allergies. I'm working on tracking my throat clearing and burping with my inability to breathe at times. I exercise daily and have some issues during excersise from time to time but what fathoms me is the fact the worst feelings of not being able to breathe come on when at rest. I'm thinking it might have something to do with GERD and H2 blockers. I've been told by other doctors that H2 Blockers such as zantac and pepcid AC act in a similar fashion within your body as antihistamines. The H2 blocker is essentially a histamine blocker and for me this makes my nose stuffy and can cause other breathing issues. I'm trying to test out using PPIs instead to see if that successfully combats the breathing difficulties. I've had mixed success so far. Sometimes ativan can help release stress and make me worry less about the breathing because as we all know on here, it shouldn't be life threatening. Don't get me wrong, the feeling sucks and ruins our quality of life, but because all of our tests are coming back negative we've got to believe it's a non-life threatening issue, right? I looks at doctors as being good at saying what your issue is NOT, not telling you what your issue is and how to solve it.Let's keep this conversation alive and share our findings."}

Make up looked great through the whole event and I cleaned off my face and eyes with clear and clear face wash, also taking off fake eyelashes right after the event. On the next day, I noticed that my face was a bit sore. I applied my regular make up myself (foundation from MAC which I never had a problem with, Maybelline mascara, Tarte blush and eyeshadow as well as Stilla eyeliner), after about 5 hours I noticed that the inner corner of my right eye got extremely shot blood red and the left eyelid was extremely swollen to the point that I couldn't get my eye to open. I was rushed to emergency where I was given benadryl, steroids and IV. Swelling on my eyes and face was there for roughly 2 days while taking benadryl and steroids. about three weeks after the \"allergic reaction\" or whatever this was, my eyes were stinging, burning, itching and still sore, bit irritated and red. I went to the eye doctor who did not see anything wrong with the eyes but he did prescribe me eye drops with antibiotic as well as cream for eyelids. Yesterday I went to allergist for allergy patch test (T.R.U.E Test) for 36 chemicals that are found in cosmetics, ointments etc. I will wear the patch test for 3 days until I find out what chemicals I am allergic to. Have anyone of you experienced allergies to cosmetics? I suspect the inflammation and \"allergic reaction\" was due to Duo Eyelash Glue used for application of eyelashes by MAC Cosmetics but I am not 100% sure. I removed a lot of old make up from my collection as well as I no longer use any make up that has harsh chemicals. I switched to Mineral Fusion foundation which works well (not too crazy about their shades selection as there are only about 8-10 shades). I also tried Almay mascara which irritated my eyes a little bit, also tried Mineral Fusion mascara which lengthen lashes perfectly but I was not satisfied how it felt on my eyes - it irritated me just a bit, also difficult time to get it off. Once mascara which I found to work effectively without much irritation is 100% Organic Physicians Formula but unfortunately it does not do any magic with getting lashes to a nice curl or length. I eliminated eyeliner completely and I no longer use any eyeshadow. I am desperately looking into make up cosmetics that do not have any harsh chemical ingredients. Although I am not sure what I am allergic to yet, I want to completely switch over my make up collection to 100% safe cosmetics. Anyone of you recommends any brands other than Mineral Fusion? I am specifically looking for something that does not include allergens such as formaldehyde (also found in eyelash glue) etc. Thanks!"}

What I can share is I started having issues with mascara in my late 40's. My eyes would get red & irritated, even with removing it at night the next morning they would be what I called goopy & crusty. And then I started losing my eye lashes. I tried many, many different mascaras after that trying to find something that didn't irritate so much. Back then Almay was the least irritating & I still use it to this day. However, I do not use it daily. I am considering trying Este Lauder again, it was one that did not cause so much of a problem. As for any kind of facial cleaners & make up I have to be very, very careful. I have always had very sensitive skin, most of the facial cleaners make my face look like I have been under a sun lamp, same with moisturizers. I have used some Clinique products & have done pretty good with those. Body lotions I have to be careful with, a lot of redness & itching. At best you need to see the results of your testing & then perhaps search online for different products. It will be time consuming for sure. Sorry that I am not of any help.

I couldn't fall asleep again because I couldn't breathe again; nose blocked up completely, felt like heavy weights were on my chest, couldn't yawn or take deep breaths, my breathing just felt extremely restricted and it was triggering anxiety. I took either Clonazepam or Lorazepam, can't remember, thinking maybe it was purely anxiety, but it didn't improve 3 hours later. I ended up just getting up, went to get my healthcard renewed (good thing I did, too...), and throughout the day, the breathing issues worsened and I developed fleeting chest pain, right next to my sternum. I wondered if maybe working out had done something? 26 hours of no sleep later, I was so exhausted I just passed out at 6pm on Friday and slept 10 hours. When I woke up, I couldn't breathe again, and had chest pain again. It kept getting worse. I called a 24/7 healthline here and the nurse instructed me to go the ER immediately based on my symptoms, which triggered a panic attack, which caused the breathing difficult to get even worse... So I was taken to urgent care on Saturday, I was stuck there for over 6 hours straight. They did an EKG, x-ray, and some 3-hour-long blood test to check if I had blood clots or pulmonary embolism. Everything came back clear/negative, the 5 doctors and 1 nurse I saw all said I appeared to be healthy and completely fine. I explained to them that this has been an ongoing issue but that it got worse and I literally have not been able to breathe right for over 36 hours, and they did nothing for me at the hospital, no extensive tests. Didn't even check my oxygen levels or do an echo'. They said my heart, lungs, ribs and blood all appeared to be 100% fine, strong and healthy. I was told \"it's probably just a virus\", gave me a Ventolin inhaler, and sent me home. Well, yesterday, I had 3 more \"attacks\" of being unable to breathe. I took Ventolin once, two puffs, and felt a little bit better 30 minutes later. Then, not even an hour later, came the third attack, which left me doubled over wheezing because it was so bad. I ended up sobbing in bed and trembling, unable to speak or move, because I was so scared and just could not breathe. And I couldn't take any more Ventolin puffs. I took Lorazepam and opened my window to bring fresh air into my room, ended up falling asleep at some point and woke up with really bad confusion. I felt mostly okay the rest of the night. Today, minor shortness of breath all day, chest pain has diminished completely, I was hoping I was starting to get better, but I've had a few attacks today as well. No Ventolin (idky, I feel like I shouldn't use it... and who knows when my doctor will finally listen to me and write me an inhaler prescription, so I don't want to use all of this inhaler, it's all I have). Overall (longterm and shortterm) I've tried steam inhalation, inhalers, eating more (bc it gets worse if I'm hungry), stronger ranitidine (I have GERD that occasionally gets worse for a couple days), vitamins, different types of iron (I'm also anemic), no improvement. And doctors don't seem to be able to find anything wrong with me. Does this sound like asthma? If not, what do you think this is? Anyone else ever had this and found a solution? It's really tiring being unable to breathe 24/7 and not even being able to sleep anymore for more than 5 hours at a time bc I feel like I'm suffocating.EDIT: I'm almost 21, bio female (transmale, not on hormones yet), no history of drug use or smoking (but have been exposed to second-hand smoke an average amount), only other person in the family with inhalers is mom but she doesn't even use/need them, never had tests for sleep apnea done, never had echocardiogram or stress test done (idk what's up with the doctors here but they just won't do it), was never told the results of my spirometry test 2yrs ago.Post Edited (Aryn) : 11/27/2017 3:52:02 PM (GMT-7)"}

Early last year, I developed the sensation of shortness of breath. I was told it was anxiety by every specialist at the time. I'm a 24-yr old male. The testing I had done is as follows:Cardiologist: ekg (x4)echocardiogramstress test1. All results were \"normal\", aside from \"mitral valve regurgitation so minor that it couldnt be causing any symptoms\". Pulmonologist:Chest xray (x3)Spirometry MRI2. Indicated asthma. Not COPD, apparently. No blood clots or fluid. Inhalers did nothing to help, and it still begs the question - why is the shortness of breath every second of every day and night?Gastro:EndoscopySinus x-ray3. Results indicated esophagitis and gastritis, and most likely barrett's esophagus according to the pathologist. Chronic sinusitis indicated. Allergist:Allergy test4. Results indicated a dust mite allergy. I would find it hard to believe that an allergy could be causing 24/7 shortness of breath with no other allergic reaction. I've had bloodwork done on two occasions, each time finding nothing unusual.My daily symptoms are as follows:1.Constant (literally) shortness of breath which seems worse in the morning. Greater difficulty breathing through nose but still feel like i can't get a full breath at all so even with my mouth i have to basically gasp for air regularly.2.Frequent palpitations and anxiety3. Spitting up clear phlegm, occasionally brown.4. Lightheadedness, disorientation, dizziness, etc.5. Pain in both sides of chest, as if in my lungs.6. Heartburn I've been smoking for 6 years, and I drink alcohol regularly. I realize how irresponsible this is considering my complaints. Despite that, I suppose my question is:Obviously, the compilation of inflammatory conditions, cancerous pre-requisites, and looming heart failure are daunting. But before I succumb, I'd at least like to breathe normally again. Asthma was the only seemingly definitive condition I was diagnosed with that was related to my lungs and breathing. Could this be asthma? 24/7?Post Edited (Paul's Brother) : 11/2/2017 10:44:34 AM (GMT-6)"}

There can be one single ingredient that causes allergic reactions and you are simply not aware of what it is yet.

As I aged, my body changed and many of my \"allergies\" disappeared entirely ~ including cats, pollens, etc However, suddenly I had become lethally allergic to string beans which I'd eaten my entire life. Would have extreme allergic reactions  [giant swollen eyes, nose running like a river] until one time I went into anaphylactic shock and nearly died.

I now have the worst allergy problems I've ever had in my life. I am certain it's due to mold ~  but also may be in combination w/another type of pollen that I've never been exposed to. I don't know but I am frigging DYING w/the worst skin rash from head to toe. I look like the elephant man and have not had one good night's sleep in months since I itch 24/7. My life is utter hell.

I have allergies as well as a more recent diagnosis of asthma and was hoping to get some feed back about allergy shots for antibiotics. I've been allergic to Amoxicillin and erythromycin since I was a child. And have just recently developed an allergy to Bactrim. In college one of the Drs on campus when faced with needing to prescribe me something for an infection suggested I look into having allergy shots to make me less sensitive so I had more options available. At the time I thought he was crazy. Mainly because I was a college student making minimum wage without health insurance. But as my allergies seem to be getting more severe and more numerous the thought has come to mind. Has anyone here had success with allergy shots? Especially ones targeted at antibiotic allergy?Also curious to talk with someone who has asthma.I developed breathing problems a couple of years ago and was living in California at the time. The Pulmonologist I saw gave me no diagnosis accept sleep apnea. After several sleep studies I was fitted with a cpap. The dr prescribed the highest setting the machine went to and I was completely unable to use it. He refused to lower the setting and I can't sleep if it blows air into me so forcefully that I can't keep my mouth shut. I also have a very difficult time breathing through my nose. In June of 2016 I moved to Texas to live with my cousin and his family. My breathing was so bad that I was no longer able to care for myself and my cousins family was willing to take care of me and help me get healthy again. At my first Drs appointment my second week in Texas the dr immediately put me on oxygen. She referred me to a wonderful Pulmonologist who diagnosed me with copd and put me on spiriva and symbicort. With the oxygen I was slowly able to do more and more. The medication was working and the dr. Changed my diagnosis to asthma.I've had many of my Drs ask me what caused my lung problems and I simply have no answer. The doctors have never told me and I don't exhibit the classic symptoms of asthma. I've never experienced an asthma attack where I all of a sudden have trouble breathing. So I'm still questioning my diagnosis. Could someone tell me there experience with asthma. I can't tell when I need to use my rescue inhaler. Sometimes I feel like I'm trying to breathe through a wet sponge. But when I check my pulse ox it's 95. So I figure it's not necessary. I'm also no longer on 24 hour oxygen. I only use it at night. My sleep study shows my sleep apnea is very mild now so I don't understand why I still need the oxygen at night. Just laying down my pulse ox automatically drops to around 93. I sleep on an adjustable bed with the head raised. I also have Drs ask me if I have been using my oxygen during the day when I've had more difficulty breathing. I don't know how to determine when that's necessary. None of them will tell me a specific pulse ox at which to start using it during the day if I'm having problems. I think I'm just disheartened right now because of the whole antibiotic fiasco. I was prescribed Bactrim DS twice a day for ten days as well as given a steroid shot and prescribed a six day pack of steroids. Everything was fine until the steroids were done and I continued to take the antibiotics. The evening of the seventh day ( my first day without steroids) my legs were really itchy. I put lotion on assuming it was because of dry skin. When I woke up the next morning the itching was much worse. As the day went on I started to feel some chest congestion. I was already taking Benadryl by this time on recommendation by the oncall nurse who said she didn't like the idea of switching antibiotics and starting me on another round of ten days. I heartily agreed. I ended up having to call again because there was no way I was going to continue the antibiotics when the itchy bumps spread over my entire body. She agreed to call in another round of steroids. I hate antibiotics. I think I would rather die than go through this again.When I was having respiratory symptoms because of the allergy it felt like it was hard to get air into my lungs and i had to really take deep breaths to get it into my lungs. It made me cough just a little as well and when I did it hurt a little and had a funny taste to it. Almost like blood. Is this what an asthma attack is like?My mom had a brother who died from cystic fibrosis as an infant and I don't know any of my family history on my dad's side. I've even wondered if that could be a possibility. I know if I mentioned it to a doctor they would think I was a hypochondriac because I'm 37 and overweight. Just wish the new pack of steroids would kick in and alleviate the itching and chest symptoms.I made some paragraphs to make your post easier to read.Post Edited By Moderator (straydog) : 11/26/2017 7:52:14 AM (GMT-7)"}

Are you by chance a smoker?  I have severe allergy reactions to penicillin & the sisters to it. This happened in my early 30's & came out of no where. However, this is not uncommon, it can happen with any medication. I have never heard of someone being desensitized to antibiotics, at least it has never been offered to me. Just know that because you have has reactions to these antibiotics, there are many more that you can be treated with. My drs just work around what I cannot be given. I have COPD from smoking. I ended up in the ER & spent a week in the hospital getting my oxygen levels straightened out. I went home on oxygen 24/7. I was that way for many years. Over time I was able to only need it at night. During the day I will use it if I start to feel a little winded or start wheezing. I can tell when to use it during the day. The winter is really a hard time for me, I use it more during the day then. I know of a couple people that were dx'd with COPD that never smoked in their life.Asthma is something a person can develop at any time. You do not have to be born with it. Since your dx was changed to asthma I wonder why the dr made that determination. I would have asked. Asthma can either be mild or severe. Often the same medications are used to treat both.If your oxygen drops at night, I am not convinced its asthma causing. The sleep apnea could also be a culprit. It sounds like you had a terrible dr that gave that dx. May be worth considering being re-tested. If your oxygen level is dropping down at night, something is going on to cause. Low oxygen makes the heart work harder, apnea also affects the heart.One thing I will caution you on is the steroids. They should not be used very often or for long term. They affect the adrenals & have some nasty side effects. Most people will tell you its a love hate relationship, love how they make you feel but hate what it does to the body.If yu haven't seen the pulmonary dr in awhile, it would probably be worthwhile to be retested. Not just breathing into a spirometer. Take care.SusieModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums"}

No I am not a smoker. I have an appointment for a breathing test next Friday and then will see the Pulmonologist the following Wednesday. I really do like the Pulmonologist I'm seeing however my insurance will be changing from regular Medicare to a Medicare advantage hmo so I don't think I'll be able to keep him as my dr anyway. I'm praying that I'm making the right decision by joining the hmo. The freedom I had with regular Medicare was nice but very expensive. My out of pocket medical expenses this last year have been over $20,000. The problem with the antibiotics is that I'm allergic to so many and such a wide variety that most Drs have a hard time finding one to fit the specific type of infection that I happen to have at the time. Not all antibiotics work for every type of infection. They usually want to give me Cipro or Levaquin. I get bad side effects from them as well. Not allergic those class of antibiotics are just really hard on your body. The steroids will not be long term. I've had a couple surgeries on my stomach so steroids in pill form are not a good idea for me anymore. The first six days of steroids were to help me function while I was sick. I had extreme fatigue. However they were suppressing the allergy symptoms from the antibiotics. So on the day after I finished the first six day course of antibiotics I started to break out in a rash and have difficulty breathing. That's why I was given the second six day course. To stop the allergic reaction.  I understand the love hate relationship now. They also make it very difficult for me to sleep. Something I already have trouble with. Thank you so much for taking the time to respond to my post and share your advice and concern. Hope you have a wonderful day Larisa"}

Symptoms range from terrible headaches to allergic rhinitis [nose running], asthma & severe skin rash.I read your reply very carefully. Anaphylactic shock from food allergy occurs quickly ~ not 2 hours later. So it seems logical your toxic allergen is something in your environment.It was once explained to me that allergic reactions can be like a bow and arrow. You draw back the bow further and further with each allergy attack and then one day ~~BOOM~~ the arrow shoots all the way out and the body goes into deep shock... which can indeed be fatal.You have been told how serious is anaphylactic shock? YOU MUST HAVE TWO EPI-PENS. Get another one today. In case the ambulance does not arrive quickly YOU NEED TO INJECT YOURSELF A SECOND TIME or have a friend or neighbor help you administer a second dose of epinephrine in 15 minutes.Do you have a person nearby you can discuss your allergy problem? You need someone that is willing to help if you go into anaphylactic shock. You have 30 minutes to get to a hospital. It's very dangerous. I am worried about you!I know about mold allergy since it's happening to me. It's a nightmare. I moved from another state and rented a condo online from looking at photos. I had a friend check the place in person for me. She did not do a very good examination of the property. When I walked in I smelled mold immediately. It is very pungent. I immediately experienced horrible symptoms and went to emergency care.. I've been on prednisone for months which barely controls the violent skin rash I have on my arms & legs. It's truly awful.To answer your question, you don't need to touch the mold. You only need to breathe the spores. Most people have problems with lungs and rhinitis [runny nose] but in my case it's manifested as a terrible skin rash. I was tested as a child and on a scale of 1 to 10 mold was an \"11\". I never lived in an environment like I do right now since I lived in L.A. which is basically a desert and very dry. I moved to Florida which is very wet ~ and boy ~ am I paying for it since I've been told by local residents that mold is everywhere due to intense moisture in climate.Since you are in 20 below weather, I don't know your environment as I've never lived in the cold. However, wherever there is moisture [rain, snow, etc] there can be mold in between the walls. You can have the air tested [very expensive] or insist your allergist test you ASAP for mold.Please get a second Epi-pen RIGHT AWAY!!!!Let me know how you are doing. I send you my very best wishes."}

I have had lumbar punctures, nerve blocks, tons of medicines and antibiotics, and even surgery. Finally, my ENT decided I had to have allergies because of the inflammation in my sinuses and ears with out infection. So I got skin tested for allergies, environmental and food. I tested positive on 30/35 environmental allergies. I tested positive or borderline on only 8/24 foods. My biggest allergies are orange, milk and bakers yeast. I was told to completely cut them out and I am having issues with that because there is milk in soooooo many things. My other allergy/intolerance as far as food goes corn, soy, rye, rice, and oats. I have eaten corn and had digestive issues but never seemed to have issues with corn chips ect. also I am not sure what about rice. I have eaten rice several times and never had any noticeable issues. Could it be that I am always noticing a headache and joint pain that could be coming from the rice or corn? Or even the oats. I am at a loss here, I go back on the 21st of this month to go over the entire allergy work up, so I will have more information then. Has anyone else tested positive on something with the skin allergy test that didn't seem to bother them? I am new here and I was trying to look through older posts to see if there was anything like that. I thank you very much for any time or help you may have.  "}

The foods included things like soy, peanuts, potatoes, tomatoes, green beans, and others.  I did an elimination diet, getting rid of all the things I tested positive for.  After a couple of months, I hadn't noticed any difference.  So I started adding them back in to my diet, one by one, and didn't notice any change there either.  At that point my allergy doctor admitted that the skin tests for food allergies aren't reliable (they are much more reliable for airborne allergens like pollens that elicit a response in the airways).The funny thing is, I've only had a reaction to one food - shrimp - yet my skin tests for shrimp allergies were negative!"}

I have eaten some beef fried rice, and am now dealing with the consequences. It is nice to know that it isn't irritable bowl or anything and nice to also know now that I can tie it to something. I never really put too much thought into it because my stomach issues have been such a rollercoaster that it never seemed to be tied to anything really. I am now keeping track of what I eat and how my body reacts to see what if anything that I need to eliminate completely. I will start an elimination diet now and see if I can try anything else on the list in a few weeks. I know now that rice will not be one of the things I reintroduce. My big issues are orange, yeast, and milk. I had no idea about the yeast but have had issues with orange and milk for years. I drink almond milk and just stay away from oranges and their juice. Now I will have to test bakers yeast first and foremost because I am in love with homemade rolls and bread. I cannot get through thanksgiving or Christmas without them! I never really liked much soy anyway so that will not be a problem to remove, except that it is in a ton of things. I make a lot of my foods from scratch anyway, so I am guessing that is why I never realized the issues. I do know that corn is not my friend but I don't understand eating a corn tortilla has never seemed to cause me any problems. Now that I am keeping track, I am sure that I will notice something subtle maybe. Again thank you for you reply. I am hoping that an elimination diet will help me tremendously. It seems to be helpful for many people."}
